# Level0

## Analysis

By using ls, we can see that the binary has suid permissions for `level1`

```bash
level0@RainFall:~$ ls -l
total 732
-rwsr-x---+ 1 level1 users 747441 Mar  6  2016 level0
```

We decompile the binary to understand the content with `ghidra`. It seems to execute `/bin/sh` depending on a comparison with arg[1]. If the first arg is set to 423, it runs a new shell with suid rights.

Once the new shell is open, we simply have to print the contents of `.pass`:

```bash
$ cat /home/user/level1/.pass
1fe8a524fa4bec01ca4ea2a869af2a02260d4a7d5fe7e7c24d8617e6dca12d3a
```
