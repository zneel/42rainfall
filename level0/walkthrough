# Level0

## Analysis

By using ls, we can that binary have suid user for `level1`

```bash
level0@RainFall:~$ ls -l
total 732
-rwsr-x---+ 1 level1 users 747441 Mar  6  2016 level0
```

We decompile binary to understand the content with `ghidra`. It seems to execute `/bin/sh` depending to a comparaison with arg[1]. If first arg is set to 423, it run new shell with suid right.

One new shell is openn, we simply have to print `.pass` content:
```
$ cat /home/user/level1/.pass
1fe8a524fa4bec01ca4ea2a869af2a02260d4a7d5fe7e7c24d8617e6dca12d3a
```
